## Introduction
This is a code repository for Corona Tracker Application. 

 I have build a full COVID-19 Tracker. I have used  React, Charts.JS and Material UI.

By looking in the code you will get hold of React's workflow and the use of hooks.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api


Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
